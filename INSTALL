Very soon there should be packages for installing via apt and brew. But in any
case, here's what you need to do manually:

Put bin/construct somewhere where you have your binaries (such as /usr/local/bin )
Add the following environment variable to your .bash_profile or .profile or
.bashrc :

  export CONSTRUCT_ADDONS="...path-to.../construct/lib"

(replacing with the actual path to the lib directory of course)
