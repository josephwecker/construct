* .constructrc - Python that gets called for the current directory before
  construct does its thing.
* construct - command-line command. Either specify a rule file, pipe one in, or
  it looks for buildspec
* (.deps - Automatically created, dependency tree. Don't add to your repository.)


* When a buildspec specifies running construct in a different directory, it
  doesn't double-memoize
* Easily installed on mac + linux


* Which directories to watch for dependency creation. (default all children of
  .constructrc?) - automatically also changes working directory?
* Easy way to specify working directory (and going back)
* .constructrc's in parent directories loaded always? Yes

* use psyco


* How hard would it be to, say, replace rebar, including all application
  building etc.

* Installable modules, like for erlang etc. (application building- so like a
  generic capistrano)
